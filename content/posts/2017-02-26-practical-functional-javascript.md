I have made a video to go alongside my last post series. In that series, I focused on showing what it means to write practical functional Javascript. Just like all my other posts, this is done by building something, a Mad Libs generator. The problems that arise from building a Mad Libs generator are perfectly suited to solving in a functional manner. The series is broken up into three parts, first creating a functional backend, then rendering it to the page, and finally testing.

This video maps closely with the first post. It firsts introduces functional ideas like composition and currying. Then it jumps right in and shows how to use these in an actual application. Watch and enjoy.
