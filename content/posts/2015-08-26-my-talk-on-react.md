This is a talk I gave for a local [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/localvariables/) about React. It is called ‘Why I like React’. I cover the basics of building React components. Then I spend some time talking about functional programming. Finally I wrap it all together to show how React is functional in nature. The final demo shows how to ‘think in React’.
