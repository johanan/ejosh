This is a talk I gave for a local [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/localvariables/) about node.js. I cover building an Express-like package from scratch. It does not have all the features of Express and is not ready for production. It does show you how to build a package including testing. The example package is at <https://github.com/johanan/example-simple-app>. The project in the video is at <https://github.com/johanan/Local-Variables-Dec-2014>.  
  
You may have to turn the volume up as it was recorded from the audience.
