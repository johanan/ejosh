I have been using Google Music ever since I was able to get an account. I have already synced all the my music to it. It works great in my browser. I have one issue though. This:  
[![Multiple Tabs](http://ejosh.co/de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/multi-tabs.png "multi-tabs")](http://ejosh.co/de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/multi-tabs.png)  
It becomes just another tab in my browser. It could even be just another tab in just another instance of Chrome. This is a pain. A song I donâ€™t like comes up and I want to go to the next or my phone rings and I need to pause the song. It is a firstworldproblem, but annoying nonetheless.

I wanted to make it more of an app. It should have its own spot in my taskbar. Because I run Windows 7 it should pinned as well so it is always there.

## Chrome to the rescue

Google Chrome makes this easy. Navigate to your Google Music page <http://music.google.com>. Click the little wrench &gt; Tools &gt; Create application shortcuts. You should get a window that pops up letting you choose where to put the shortcut.[![Google Music Application Shortcut](http://ejosh.co/de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/music-app-shortcut.png "music-app-shortcut")](http://ejosh.co/de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/music-app-shortcut.png)

It will now work just like any other application and have its own spot in your taskbar.
