<p>This is a story that starts in Paris and ends in Regency era England.</p>

<p>My wife and I recently returned from a trip to London and Paris. During our visit, we explored the renowned <a href="https://www.pucesdeparissaintouen.com/en/">Les Puces de Saint-Ouen</a> flea market in Paris. It is a maze of booths and buildings of booths with hundreds of vendors selling everything. </p>

<p>We find a stall with a selection of books priced at â‚¬1. One particular book caught my eye as there is a face of an onion-headed man (ðŸ§…ðŸ‘¨) staring right at me. The book is in French. I can neither read nor speak French. I had to have THIS BOOK. </p>

<p>The entire transaction turned into an adventure as I only had 10 quid on me. I had to find the owner of the stall, who immediately referred me to someone that spoke English. I tried give him Â£10 for the book, but he gave me directions where I could exchange Pounds for Euros. </p>

<p>I do not blame him. If someone offered me Candian Dollars or Pesos, even if it were 10X the value, I would decline. I then tried to use an ATM, but it did not work with American networks. Finally we decided to find the currency exchange that the Frenchman had recommended and get Euros. I do not remember how far away it was, but it was much further then we were lead to believe. I was able to exchange the Â£10 for â‚¬10 and something (I know, not a great rate, but I needed this book). </p>

<p>Finding our our way back and discovering no one was at the shop, I left the â‚¬10 on a table and left with the book, which he had set aside. He was across the way at a cafe and I tried to just say keep the Euros, but he gave me change, of which he did not have exact change and by the end I only paid half a Euro. I want to humbly thank this unkown French man for being helpful. Although next time just take the tourist's money.</p>

<h2>Docteur Bizarre: Science-Fantasy Book by Jack Vance</h2>
<p>At this point I must show the cover. I am sure that the cover is already visible. This is the cover and the very first page of Docteur Bizarre by Jack Vance.</p>

{{< srcset src="docteur_bizarre_cover.webp" alt="Onion headed main cover of the book Docteur Bizarre" caption="I had to have this book." >}}

<p>The cover states, according to Google Translate:</p>

<blockquote>The relic came stealthily from the rock. A skinny creature, emaciated, with tormented eyes. It moved in a series of rapid jerks.</blockquote>

<p>First of all, that onion-headed man (ðŸ§…ðŸ‘¨) does not look emaciated. Nor does he have tormented eyes. It casts doubt over the rest of the book, which I cannot confirm, from the aforementioned French.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT</h2>
<p>I recently started using ChatGPT to create the featured images for some of my posts. I usually just let it start with an image and then based on that image I will have it refine and focus in on specific things until I get an image I think represents the abstract idea of my post. This process takes a dozen or so iterations for something that I want to use emerges.</p>

<p>Here is that process for Docteur Bizarre. Portions of the conversation have been edited that add nothing. ChatGPT can be very dull and uninspired. Although I have left in my many grammar mistakes.</p>

        Ok, so let's imagine that Docteur Bizarre is Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. What would an interaction between Docteur Bizarre(Mr Darcy) and Elizabeth Bennet?

        <p>Imagining Docteur Bizarre as Mr. Darcy from "Pride and Prejudice," his unique characteristics would certainly add a whimsical layer to the classic tale. Here's a scene where Docteur Bizarre, in the guise of Mr. Darcy, interacts with Elizabeth Bennet:</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>The grand ball at Netherfield was a spectacle of light and sound, with the gentry of Hertfordshire gathered in their finest attire. Amidst the swirl of silks and satins, Elizabeth Bennet's eyes found their curious subject across the room: Mr. Darcyâ€”though in this peculiar world, he was known as Docteur Bizarre, an enigmatic gentleman with a head shaped like an onion.</p>
        <p>He stood apart from the dancing and merriment, his gaze intense and yet distant, as if his thoughts lingered elsewhere. Elizabeth approached, her curiosity piqued by the odd gentleman who had caused so much stir in their community.</p>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
<strong>Elizabeth Bennet:</strong>
Mr. Darcy, you seem most contemplative this evening. Is the assembly not to your liking?

<strong>Docteur Bizarre (Mr. Darcy):</strong>
Miss Bennet, you mistake me. I am merely... unaccustomed to such lively company.

His voice was smooth, the onion layers shifting slightly with each word, as if his emotions were close to the surface.

<strong>Elizabeth Bennet:</strong>
(laughing lightly)
Sir, I imagine our country manners quite differ from those of London society. Perhaps they are too... pungent for your taste?

<strong>Docteur Bizarre (Mr. Darcy):</strong>
On the contrary, I find there is much to be admired hereâ€”particularly the candor for which you are so celebrated.

Elizabeth met his gaze, noting the layers of meaning in his words and the peculiar scent of sincerity.

<strong>Elizabeth Bennet:</strong>
You flatter me, Mr. Darcy. But I wonder, does your unique... constitution grant you insight into the character of those you meet?

<strong>Docteur Bizarre (Mr. Darcy):</strong>
Indeed, Miss Bennet. One might say, I have an ability to peel away the superficial layers of society.

A playful sparkle lit Elizabeth's eyes.

<strong>Elizabeth Bennet:</strong>
Then, Mr. Darcy, perhaps you shall uncover that beneath the propriety, we are all but humble bulbs in the garden of life, striving towards the light.

<strong>Docteur Bizarre (Mr. Darcy):</strong>
(chuckling softly)
A most... enlightened observation.

Their conversation was cut short by the call for the next dance, but the exchange lingered with them both. As the evening wore on, Elizabeth found her thoughts returning to the strange yet compelling Docteur Bizarre, whose onion-head bore a remarkable resemblance to the depth and complexities of the heart.

        <p>In this whimsical adaptation, the essence of the characters is preserved while allowing for a playful interlude that bridges Austen's world with the surreal charm of Docteur Bizarre.</p>

        The revised cover art for the prestige television show, which is an adaptation of "Docteur Bizarre" within the context of "Pride and Prejudice," is now ready. It reflects the unique blend of these two narratives.

<p>I would watch the BBC adaptation of this on Netflix.</p>
<p>I will admit I was not ready for the onion puns (punion?). </p>

<p>Nor was I ready for Mr. Darcy's appearance.</p>
