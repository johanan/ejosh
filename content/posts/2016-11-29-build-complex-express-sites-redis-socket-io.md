I have another video series ready from Packt Publishing named [Build Complex Express Sites with Redis and Socket.io](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/build-complex-express-sites-redis-and-socketio-video). This course builds on the foundation from the other course I built for Packt Publishing earlier this year, [The Complete Guide to Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/complete-guide-nodejs-video).

It starts off by covering what and why of Redis. Then goes to building Express sites using Redis. After that, the course jumps to using Socket.io to build real-time sites. Just like Redis the course begins simple and covers what Socket.io is. The course finishes up building sites in Express utilizing Socket.io.
