I have just recently finished creating a video series for Packt Publishing named [The Complete Guide to Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/complete-guide-nodejs-video). The course focuses on taking someone completely new to Node.js and giving them a great foundation to start building real applications. There is a good mix of theory and practical application as the viewer goes through the course. First, an idea is introduced and explained. Then the idea is applied.

While I was waiting on Packt to send me some finalized videos as a preview, I received a twitter endorsement for the course.
